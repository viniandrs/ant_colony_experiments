# Ant Colony experiments

I decided to make this repository to make some experiments with Ant System Optimization, a class of optimization algorithms I discovered on my Artificial Intelligence college subject.

Initially I'm implementing algorithms to solve the Traveller Salesman Problem, but I intend to use it to try to solve other problems as well.

My goal with this project is to make easy and clean implementations of the solutions with great visualizations and explanations.
