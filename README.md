# Ant Colony experiments

I decided to make this repository to make some experiments with Ant Colony Optimization, an algorithm I discovered on a college class of Artificial Intelligence.

Initially I implemented it to solve the Traveller Salesman Problem, but I intend to use it to try to solve other problems as well.

My goal with this project is to make easy and clean implementations of my solutions with great visualizations.
